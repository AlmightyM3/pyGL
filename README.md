# pyGL
A project to learn OpenGL and GPU-based 3d rendering with help from learnopengl.com in Python with Pygame-ce.
 
# ToDo:
Done as of 2025/08/14. 
I have learned a lot by making this project, although looking at it now it is quite obvious that I made a bunch of mistakes. Luckily, I plan on fixing some of these mistakes with a newer 3D renderer which will not be made in Python. 

# Originally wanted, but saved for future projects:
- Text rendering
- Post processing
- Volumetric lighting
- Physics?
- PBR?
- Terrain?
